# CircuitPython
This repo has all of my CircuitPython assignments. 

fading_led: Makes an led fade from on to off and back.
 
lcd_button_press: Makes it so when you press the button a number prints on the lcd screen. It also has a switch that makes it either count up or down.
 
servo_touch_control: Code for when you have two wires in the metroExpress plus a servo wired. When you touch one wire it turns one way and vice versa.
 
photointerrupter: Code for a photo interrupter. When the photo interrupter is interupted it prints the number of times it has been interrupted on the serial monitor aswell as that it has been interrupted.

Distance_sensor: as you move slowly away from the distance sensor the led on the Metroexpress fades from red to blue to green.
