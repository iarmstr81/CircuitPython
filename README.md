# Fading LED
## Description
Makes an led fade from on to off and back.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to use elif (else if)
## Picture
This is a picture of the wiring

# Servo Touch Control
## Description 
Code for when you have two wires in the metroExpress plus a servo wired. When you touch one wire it turns one way and vice versa.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- You can touch a wire that is in a digitalpin and make it do something.

# Lcd Button Press
## Description
Makes it so when you press the button a number prints on the lcd screen. It also has a switch that makes it either count up or down.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to download and use different libraries.

# Photo Interrupter
## Description 
Code for a photo interrupter. When the photo interrupter is interupted it prints the number of times it has been interrupted on the serial monitor aswell as that it has been interrupted.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to use the new photointterupters and wire them.

# Distance Sensor
## Description
As you move slowly away from the distance sensor the led on the Metroexpress fades from red to blue to green.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to map the distance from the sensor.

# RGB
## Description
This code creates a module and class to make a code that we were given to work. The code goes through a series of colors two at a time and then at the end fades through the rainbow. We did this using 2 rgb leds.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to turn a RGB different colors.
- How to make one color fade to the next.

# FancyLED and Two Fancy
## Description
This is code that is combining using class and LEDs. We were given the code on two_fancy I then just changed the pins to work for me. After that I wrote the code for what each function would do. For example blink makes 3 of the LEDs to all flash at the same time. I then did that for each function in the code we were given.
## Lesson(s) Learned
- How to set up different functions in a class
- How to make multiple LEDs to do different things at the same time.
