My CircuitPython

This repo has all of my CircuitPython assignments. The first code fading_led makes an led fade from on to off and back. The next code lcd_button_press makes it so when you press the button a number prints on the lcd screen. It also has a switch that makes it either count up or down. Next servo_touch_control is code for when you have two wires in the metroExpress plus a servo wired. When you touch one wire it turns one way and vice versa. Photointerrupter is code for a photo interrupter. When the photo interrupter is interupted it prints the number of times it has been interrupted on the serial monitor aswell as that it has been interrupted.
